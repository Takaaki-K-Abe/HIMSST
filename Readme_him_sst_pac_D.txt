Daily Sea Surface Temperature in the western north Pacific

Term : from February 1st, 2017 to latest
Area : 0.0 - 60.0N, 100.0E - 180.0, 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree
Method : HIgh resolution Merged satellite and in-situ data Sea Surface Temperature (HIMSST)

Explanation:
HIMSST is analyzed based on SSTs derived from geostationary satellite's sensor (Himawari-8/AHI), polar orbiting satellite's infrared sensors (NOAA/AVHRR, MetOp/AVHRR), microwave sensors (Coriolis/WINDSAT, GCOM-W1/AMSR-2) and in-situ platform (buoys and ships). 
The Himawari-8/AHI data and NOAA/AVHRR High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) data of the area adjacent to Japan are received and processed at the Meteorological Satellite Center of JMA. 
NOAA/AVHRR and MetOp/AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) data are provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA. 
AMSR-2 data are provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). 
In-situ SSTs are collected at JMA via GTS, the Internet, and facsimile, and those are used for correction of biases in satellite SSTs.

Data Format:
One data file consists of 601 records, one header record and 600 data records. 
The header record contains the year, month, and day in four digits each from the left. 
Each data record includes 800 grid point values and each value is written in three digits from west to east, with unit in 0.1 degree Celsius. Data records are arranged from north to south.
That is, the first value of the first data record is for the grid centered at 59.95N and 100.05E, and the last value of the last data record is for that at 0.05N and 179.95E, respectively.
'888' denotes the region of sea ice, and '999' denotes the region of land and the value cannot be determined.
